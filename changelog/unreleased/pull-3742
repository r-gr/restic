Change: Replace `--repo2` option used by init/copy with `--from-repo`

The `init` and the `copy` command can read data from another repository.
However, confusingly `--repo2` referred to the repository from which the
`init` command copies parameters, but for the `copy` command `--repo2`
referred to the copy destination.

We have introduced a new option `--from-repo` which always refers to the
source repository for both commands. The old parameters names have been
deprecated but still work. To create a new repository and copy all snapshots
to it, the commands are now as follows:

```
restic -r /srv/restic-repo-copy init --from-repo /srv/restic-repo --copy-chunker-params
restic -r /srv/restic-repo-copy copy --from-repo /srv/restic-repo
```
